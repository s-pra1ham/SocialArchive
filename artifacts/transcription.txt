 Your Google Drive costs you $100 yearly for $2.0T. But this open source project on GitHub built unlimited cloud storage for free. It's called Penter Act, and it turns Telegram into your personal cloud storage. You can upload files, create folders, share access with others, and even download everything just like Google Drive, but without paying a single penny. The platform uses Telegram channels as storage backend. Divide large files into chunks to bypass the 20 point and be limit, and lets you add up to 20 bot workers to speed up uploads and downloads beating telegrams date limits. It's built with postgres and runs in Docker containers installing it is simple. Just run a Docker Compose command, set your telegram bot token and your done. The entire setup takes less than 5 minutes. Now the question is, would you trust telegram with your personal files or stick to paid cloud storage? The comment cloud and I'll send you GitHub link.
