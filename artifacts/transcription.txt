 Amul fail, Mother Dairy fail, Contrary Delight also fail. So you might have to rethink your morning cup of tea or coffee because an independent lab just tested India's biggest milk brands for safety and the results are shocking. Amul's milk showed coliform bacteria at nearly 98 times the safety limit set by FSSCI. Mother Dairy's bacterial count was 8 times and Contrary Delight was doubled. Now before you commit me, yes, coliforms in milk aren't unusual, I know, but with proper manufacturing and packaging those numbers should actually be negligible. That is literally the job of these brands. Though brands will deflect any responsibility saying that daily safety depends on the entire core supply chain from fact-trace to transport to retailers and a country as hot as ours that chain breaks easily. So these for now always always boil pouch milk before consuming but honestly that's not the answer. The thing that bothers me most is why is an independent YouTube lab going what efforts say I should already be doing it scale, this is a term that's supposed to protect us where is it and who should be held responsible for all of these lapses.
