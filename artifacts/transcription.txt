 Three settings you need to change for higher FPS and Valorant. First, go to your search bar and type in Transparency FX. You'll want to turn off both transparency effects and animation effects for the best performance. Now type in Graphic settings. Here go to Advanced Graphic settings and turn on Hardware Accelerated GPU scheduling. This will free up your CPU to give you better performance. Now go to your Task Manager and click on Startup Apps. Literally disable everything here you don't need to be running to minimize bloat, or you can just use Hyper-Tune.
