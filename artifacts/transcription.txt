 Someone just dropped 60 plus Claude skills on GitHub, so you can launch AI agents that can create PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, and even analyze your competitors ads, all inside of Claude. Once it's set up, you can say things like, create a full pitch deck for this startup. Build an Excel model from this data, or create MCP servers to integrate an external API. And it runs the entire workflow for you. You can even create your own custom skills for things you already do every week, like follow up emails, sales reports, or research briefs. If you don't have skills turned on yet, pause this video, take a screenshot of the setup steps, and follow them inside Claude. It takes under 15 minutes. This is how you turn Claude from a chatbot into a real personal assistant. If you want access to this GitHub repository, comment Claude, and we'll send you the link.
