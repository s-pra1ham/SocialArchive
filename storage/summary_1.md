## 📽️ Narrative Summary  
The video opens with ethereal footage of Prague’s Old Town cloaked in night‑time snow, the words “before Prague wakes” appearing on screen. As a gentle musical score carries us forward, the scene shifts to a luminous full moon hovering over the city’s rooftops, then to a still street where the historic clock tower stands sentinel. Throughout, there’s no crowd—just the soft crunch of footsteps on cobblestones and the faint glow of streetlamps. Overlaid captions tell us the creator rose before sunrise, stepped outside, and felt the city was theirs alone for a fleeting moment. The reel closes with a question to the audience: *Would you wake up early to explore a city?* By blending serene winter visuals with a reflective caption, the video sells the idea that the most memorable travel moments often happen when you venture out before anyone else does.
